# RTK (Rust Token Killer) - Token-Optimized Commands

## Golden Rule

**Always prefix commands with `rtk`**. If RTK has a dedicated filter, it uses it. If not, it passes through unchanged. This means RTK is always safe to use.

**Important**: Even in command chains with `&&`, use `rtk`.

## Files & Search (60-75% savings)
```bash
rtk ls <path>           # Tree format, compact (65%)
rtk read <file>         # Code reading with filtering (60%)
rtk grep <pattern>      # Search grouped by file (75%). Format flags (-c, -l, -L, -o, -Z) run raw.
rtk find <pattern>      # Find grouped by directory (70%)
```
